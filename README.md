# Client-Server-TCP-Digital-Wallet-Service
This is a client/server style TCP program written in Python that allows users to send and receive payments to a local Digital Wallet.
Users access this service asynchronously, one at a time, and the server does not allow for multiple client connections to the server simultaneously. 

This is an introduction to creating programs that send information over a network. 
My next project involving network programming will be more complex, but this was a fun start!
Please see the full report document for a description.
